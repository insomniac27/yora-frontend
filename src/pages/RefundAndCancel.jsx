            Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within
            2 days of placing the order. However, the cancellation request may
            not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
            vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping
            them.

          <li>
            YORA APPARELS PRIVATE LIMITED does not accept cancellation requests
            for products that are stated as not refundable. However,
            refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the
            quality of product delivered is not good.

            entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at
            his own end. This should be reported within 2 days of receipt of the
            products.
